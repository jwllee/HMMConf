## TL;DR
This repository contains the code, development environment, and experimental
setup for the paper. The data directory contains scripts for to download and
preprocess data. The java directory contains implementation of prefix
alignments using the Alignment package. The jupyter directory contains jupyter
notebooks for result analysis. The python directory contains the implementation
of the proposed HMM-based approach and scripts for running experiments.

### Demo
Check out a web demonstration of the technique on a real life dataset [here](https://hmmconf.herokuapp.com/). The real life dataset is on a [hospital billing process](https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:76c46b83-c930-4798-a1c9-4be94dfeb741). The code for the web app is added as a submodule to this repo and can be found [here](https://github.com/jwllee/HMMConf-demo).
